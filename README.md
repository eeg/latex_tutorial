# LaTeX tutorial

## Why LaTeX?

In class, we'll discuss what LaTeX is, in concept and in practice.
Then we'll highlight some of its awesome features.
[Notes are here.](about_latex.md)

## Access to LaTeX

LaTeX is open-source, cross-platform software.
This means you can run it for free on just about any computer.
To install LaTeX on Linux, Mac, or Windows, see the links near the top of [this Obtaining LaTeX page](https://latex-project.org/ftp.html).

Because installation is non-trivial, however, we won't require it for this introduction.
Instead, we'll be using one of the web-based LaTeX services, [Overleaf](http://www.overleaf.com).
It's free, and all you need is a web browser---everything else is handled in the cloud.

## Practice using LaTeX

Each section of this interactive tutorial illustrates some features of LaTeX and then encourages you to try them out.
